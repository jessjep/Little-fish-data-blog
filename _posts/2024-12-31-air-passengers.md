Another Tidy Tuesday submission (Global Holidays and Travel). This time, I wanted to make something a little less complicated and time-consuming. I ended up not using the global holidays data, instead making a simple heatmap showing the relative increase in international travellers compared to domestic travellers in an 8 year period.

<div class="iframe-container">

        style="border:none">
</iframe>
</div>
