This is my first submission for [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data science project open to anyone.

It's also the first interactive graphic I've made using the ggiraph package in R. It went through several iterations and was a huge learning process for me, but I'm fairly please with the final result. I would have liked to include more information (e.g. visual elements such as shapes denoting whether the spells required verbal/material/somatic components), but in trying to do so encountered many challenges. Anyway, sometimes simple is best.

I found a great deal of help in making the plot circular from [this post](https://r-graph-gallery.com/297-circular-barplot-with-groups.html) from the R Graph Galley website.
