  <h2>Some Graphs about Chess</h2>
  <p id="post-date">25 Oct 2024</p>
  <p>I was interested in plotting the number of chess players over time; specifically, whether there have been any changes in the proportion of male and female players over time.</p>

<p>The following plots are based on FIDE player data (since September 2012), so they do not represent the population of casual or online chess players—that may be a project for another day.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/chess/totals_plot.png" width="50%" alt="Plot of Total Registered Players" /></p>

<p>The number of registered players has increased over 3-fold since 2012. Female players make up about 1 in 10, which does not appear to have changed over the last 12 years. However, not all registered players are actually playing regularly. 
FIDE defines ‘active’ players as those that have played in a tournament in the last 12 months.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/chess/active_plot.png" width="50%" alt="Plot of Active Players" /></p>

<p>From September 2012 to October 2024, the proportion of inactive players increased from ~40% to ~60%, where it has been steady since 2022.</p>

<p>Thus, the trend for the number of active players looks a little different:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/chess/totals_active_plot.png" width="50%" alt="Active Players by Gender" /></p>

<p>Still, only around 1 in 10 players are female. The next plot shows the proportion of active players by gender and age. Here we can see that just under half of female players are under the age of 18, compared to around a quarter of males. This is unsurprising, and consistent with the understanding that <a href="https://www.fide.com/docs/presentations/2022%20FIDE%20Exchange%20Forum%20-%20Smerdon.pdf">girls tend to drop out of chess much sooner than boys</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/chess/proportion_plots_mf.png" width="70%" alt="Active Players by Gender" /></p>

<p>This begs the question: how has the number of girls participating in chess tournaments changed over the last decade? Well, there has been a small increase, but boys still outnumber them by more than 3 to 1:</p>
