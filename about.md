## About me

Welcome. This is a space for me to share graphs and data visualisations on various topics that interest me. I use R for data exploration and analysis, and the ggplot2 package to create plots. I am currently learning to use Illustrator for refining the aesthetics, as well as other tools such as SQL, Tableau and Power BI.
